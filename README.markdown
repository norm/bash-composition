bash-composition
================

A framework for bash initialisation, which encourages keeping many small
configuration files that share common themes or purposes, rather than one big
file with all of the things meshed together.


Installing
----------

Clone this repository, and then run `make` from within. *WARNING* This will
overwrite your `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile` file, so make sure you have
backed them up first.


Documentation
-------------

More documentation can be found in the `share/bash-composition` folder:

*   `usage.markdown` explains the general usage of the framework
*   `functions.markdown` explains what functions are provided
