bash-composition
================
A framework for bash initialisation, which encourages keeping many small
configuration files that share common themes or purposes, rather than one big
file with all of the things meshed together.


Installing
----------

Clone this repository, and then run `make` from within. *WARNING* This will
overwrite your `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile` file, so make sure you have
backed them up first.
